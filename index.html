        <img src="jxillnacio.png">
        <p>Illnacio's Creative project is renamed and integrated into the ~J<u>x</u>! Creative/Entertainment Collective. The decision is made since illnacio as a concept was too restrictive for the whole project and two separate projects would've been confusing. The comics released up until this point are kept with the same attribution to illnacio, but the upcoming ones will be released under this website under the new name.</p>
